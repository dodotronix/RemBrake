# Shopping List 

The RemBrake requires a few types of electronic components. These can be
purchased on [farnell.com](farnell.com). A pre-prepared list is already available in the user
spaceâ€”just click on "Purchase." We designed this board using only components
available there. While we cannot guarantee their availability in the future, as
of 2025, they are all in stock.

We decided to use Farnell due to delivery issues with Mouser. The remaining
components are mainly available on AliExpress. The shopping list is below.

| Module name | place to buy | ~price |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| USB-c Li-Pol / Li-on charger | | | 
| RF module | | | 
| DC/DC Boost module | | |
